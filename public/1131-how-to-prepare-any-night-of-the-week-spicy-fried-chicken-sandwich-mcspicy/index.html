<p>The crown jewel was a few pickle slices (mine were spicy/sweet) and a heavy handed shmear of honey dijonnaise. These sandwiches combine the shattering panko crispiness of katsu-style cutlets and the fiery heat found in Spread reserved spicy mayo on one side of each slice of bread. Top with chicken and shredded lettuce, then close up It's a very fool-proof recipe for someone like me who is new to frying. These baked spicy chicken sandwiches have three layers of heat and are topped with a creamy-sweet quick homemade coleslaw.</p>

<ol>
<li>You can check out my previous recipe on pickling onions or visit: <a href="https://www.fatdough.sg/post/pickle">https://www.fatdough.sg/post/pickle</a> for the recipe. You can also use store-bought.</li>
<li>You can check out my previous recipe on shokupan or visit: <a href="https://www.fatdough.sg/post/shokupan">https://www.fatdough.sg/post/shokupan</a> for the recipe. You can also use any type of soft sandwich bread.</li>
<li>Prepare the marinade. -  - In a skillet over medium heat, add cumin, fennel, coriander, white pepper, cloves, cardamom, black pepper, cinnamon, star anise, bay leaf and chili. -  - Toss and toast until aromatic. -  - Remove from heat and transfer into a spice grinder.</li>
<li>Blitz until powder forms. -  - Transfer into a shallow bowl. -  - Add in turmeric, garlic, ginger, mushroom and salt. -  - Mix to combine well. -  - In another bowl, add coconut milk and egg.</li>
<li>Lightly whisk to combine well. -  - Remove and keep the chicken skin. -  - Butterfly the chicken breast into halves. -  - Coat the chicken into the spice blend and into the coconut milk mixture.</li>
<li>Make sure the chicken is coated well and fully submerged.* -  - Cover with cling film and set aside to marinade chilled in the fridge until ready to use.</li>
<li>Prepare the salad. -  - In a bowl, mix everything together. -  - Toss to combine well. -  - Set aside chilled in the fridge until ready to use.</li>
<li>Prepare the chili mix. -  - It is best to prepare this beforehand. -  - In a bowl, add all the ingredients. -  - Mix to combine well. -  - Set aside until ready to use.</li>
<li>Prepare the sandwich. -  - In a dutch oven over medium heat, add about 3 inches of oil. -  - <em>If you insert a wooden chopstick into the oil and bubbles start to form around the chopstick, the oil is ready for frying.</em></li>
<li>In a shallow bowl, add all purpose flour, rice flour, salt and pepper. -  - Mix to combine well. -  - <em>The ratio of ap flour to rice flour is 1:1.</em></li>
<li>Gently drop the chicken skin into the oil. -  - Fried until golden brown. -  - Remove from heat. You can eat or discard. -  - <em>If you have schmaltz (rendered chicken fat) on hand, skip the above steps. Add 1 TBSP of schmaltz into the oil and mix to combine well.</em></li>
<li>Dredge the chicken into the flour mixture and back into the coconut marinade. -  - Return the chicken into the flour mixture again. -  - Press lightly with your 2 palms to adhere to the coating.</li>
<li>Gently drop into the oil away from you. -  - Deep fried until golden brown on both sides. -  - Remove from heat and set aside on a wire cooling rack.</li>
<li>Once all the chicken had done frying, remove all the oil and pour just 120g of the hot oil into the chili mixture. -  - <em>Be extremely careful when doing this.</em></li>
<li>Give it a stir to combine well. -  - Drizzle the hot oil mixture over the fried chicken, on both sides. -  - <em>The oil has to be hot or the chicken will become soggy.</em> -  - In the same dutch oven, toast just 1 side of the sandwich bread.</li>
<li>Assemble the sandwich. -  - Place sandwich onto a serving plate toasted side down. -  - Spread the salad onto the bread. -  - Place the fried chicken over the salad.</li>
<li>Drizzle some of that hot oil 1 more time. -  - Lay some pickled onions onto the chicken. -  - Drizzle some of the pickling juice over the top.</li>
<li>Place another sandwich bread over the top, toasted side up. -  - Repeat the steps for the remaining sandwiches. -  - Serve immediately.</li>
</ol>
<p>I bet you've never had a spicy chicken sandwich with yogurt in it before! Sounds weird, but stick with me. I love using basic pantry staples in fun new ways, so when. The key is to incorporate some of the wet brine into the dry flour mixture. It will create little pockets of crunch during the frying!</p>
