<h5 id="instructions-to-make-chickpea-burgers-with-spicy-tomato-salsa">Instructions to make Chickpea burgers with spicy tomato salsa:</h5>
<ol>
<li>In a food processor whizz together the chickpeas, lemon juice, 1 and a half teaspoons of curry powder, coriander, the egg, red onion and 1 tbsp of oil until it forms a smooth paste.</li>
<li>In a large bowl put 80g of the breadcrumbs and the lemon zest. Add the chickpea paste and squidge the paste and breadcrumbs together with your hands until fully combined.</li>
<li>Split the mixture into 4 equally and form 4 burger patties with your hands. The thickness and size is totally up to you.</li>
<li>Gently press each pattie in the remaining breadcrumbs until lightly coated, if you need more breadcrumbs that's fine. Chill the patties in the fridge for at least 10 minutes.</li>
<li>While the patties are chilling, make the salsa. Very simply just put all the ingredients in a food processor and whizz until your desired consistency is achieved. Some people like chunky salsa and some like it smoother. You can see the consistency that I went for in the picture below.</li>
<li>Remove the patties from the fridge. You can cook them in a variety of ways. I cooked them on the barbeque, but you can cook them under the grill or in a pan. Cook for approx 4 minutes on each side or until they start to go crispy and golden.</li>
<li>Get a burger bun and place the pattie on the bottom half. Add as much salsa as you would like on top of the pattie. Then add some crispy fresh lettuce, iceberg is best. Then put the top half of the burger bun on top and enjoy.</li>
<li>You can use any leftover salsa as a dip or other on burgers.</li>
</ol>
<p>To serve, slice each bun and fill with a slice of tomato, a burger, a few red onion slices, some cucumber slices, a dollop of chilli sauce and the Mexican bean burgers with lime yogurt &amp; salsa.
