It will take about 2 hrs, flipping halfway thru. -  - Once the cabbage has dried, transfer the carrot and scallions chili mixture into a large mixing bowl. -  - Toss in 2 layers of cabbage.</li>
<li>Coat each layer well with the chili mixture. -  - Repeat the process for the remaining layers of cabbage. -  - Transfer into the sterilized jars. Press with the back to a spoon to compact the kimchi. -  - Sealed and set aside in a cool and dry place for 24 hrs.</li>
<li>After 24 hrs, remove the lid and using the back of a spoon, press and compact. -  - If bubbles start to form, it is a good indication that it is fermenting well and there is still room to press and compact. -  - Seal and keep in a cool and dry place.</li>
<li>Repeat this process every 24 hrs up to a total of 72 hrs or 1 week. -  - The longer you allow it to ferment, the tangier and flavorful the tastes will be. -  - Once you are satisfied with the taste, chill and keep in the fridge. -  - It can be kept for up to 1 to 2 months. -  - Be sure to use clean utensils to consume the kimchi.</li>
<li>Here's the difference between 72 hrs and 7 days aged: -  - The 7 days aged kimchi is definitely far superior in terms of flavors and aftertaste. But, it might too overpowering. The 72 hrs aged kimchi does has that tanginess and spiciness. It will be perfect if the kimchi isn't the star of the dish.</li>

<p>To me, it's because it assails the senses with so many layers of texture and flavor. You have the crunch of the napa cabbage, the bright tang of the acid produced by. This vegan kimchi recipe is inspired by temple kimchi, but it's definitely NOT temple kimchi. There are five forbidden vegetables in temple cooking, and garlic and scallions are I really liked how this vegan kimchi turned out. Even if you're not vegan, I think you will love this kimchi!</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to wrap this up with this special food how to make vegan kimchi recipe. Thanks so much for your time. I&rsquo;m confident that you will make this at home. There is gonna be interesting food at home recipes coming up. Don&rsquo;t forget to bookmark this page on your browser, and share it to your family, friends and colleague. Thank you for reading.
