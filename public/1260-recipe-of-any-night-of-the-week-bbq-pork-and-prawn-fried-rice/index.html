<ol>
<li>To cook the pork: Mix all marinade ingredients together</li>
<li>Massage into the pork and transfer into a zip lock bag and seal.</li>
<li>Leave to marinate overnight or for up to 2 days.</li>
<li>Drain off excess marinade, reserving 3 Tablespoons.</li>
<li>Line a baking tray with foil and place a wire rack inside.</li>
<li>Place the pork apart on the tray and cook at 70 C for 1 hour.</li>
<li>Take the pork out and turn the oven up to 220 C</li>
<li>Baste the pork with the reserved marinade.</li>
<li>Return the pork to the oven and cook for a further 8-12 minutes until the edges are blistered and star to blacken. Remove from oven.</li>
<li>Let cool. The burnt end bits are good for nibbling. Store in refrigerator until required.</li>
<li>To cook fried rice: Swirl the oil into hot wok and saute the prawn meat and char shui until the prawns are pink. Add egg and lightly scramble.</li>
<li>Add the rice and break up with the back of your wok scoop or stirring implement.</li>
<li>Cook for about 2 minutes, stirring continously. Add the sambal and stir throughly. Add the fish sauce and stir once more.</li>
<li>To Finish: Throw in the bean sprouts and garlic chives. Stir fry 30 more seconds. Take off the heat and serve with spring onion strewn atop.</li>
<li>To cook Sambal: Over medium heat, fry onion, garlic, galangal and turmeric separately in the oil until golden brown.</li>
<li>Remove from the oil with staining spoon and set aside to cool.</li>
<li>Add dried shrimp and dried chilies to the hot oil and fry 30 seconds. Remove from the oil with straining spoon. Set aside to cool.</li>
<li>Lastly, repeat the process with the fresh red chilies, frying until dark red. Reserve the oil for another use.</li>
<li>Into a pot, add the sugar and fish sauce and bring the pot to a simmer.</li>
<li>Add the fried ingredients</li>
<li>Stir over a low heat for a further 30 seconds</li>
<li>Add the water and bring to the boil.</li>
