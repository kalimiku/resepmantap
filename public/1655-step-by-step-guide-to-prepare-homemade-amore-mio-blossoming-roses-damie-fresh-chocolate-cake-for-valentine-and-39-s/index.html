<li>Preliminaries:: Prepare 2 molds, and cover them in paper. Combine the ● ingredients and sift. *Preheat the oven to 170°C before baking.</li>
<li>Place the ○unsalted Butter into a bowl and mix into a cream, add in salt and granulated sugar, and mix until it turns white and thickens.</li>
<li>Next, add in the whisked eggs and ⋆vanilla extract and mix well. Then add in the sifted • ingredients, and mix well until it produces a &quot;glaze&quot;.</li>
<li>~Divide the batter in half. Add the ✿ cocoa to one half of the batter and mix.</li>
<li>Pour the individual batters into the prepared molds, and make an indent in the center of the batter.</li>
<li>Bake in the oven at 170°C for 35~40 minutes. Remove from the molds and cool on top of a cake cooler.</li>
<li>Making the Chocolate Glacage: ⋆Soak the gelatin in three times the amount of water (not listed).</li>
<li>Add in the ◍ ingredients and turn on the heat it dissolve it, add in the cocoa, and mix until smooth.</li>
<li>Add in the heavy cream and bring to a boil, turn off the heat and let the residual heat subside, and add in the gelatin and dissolve it. Strain once, and let cool to about skin temperature.</li>
<li>Putting it together: Cut the surface off the cake, cut into two 2cm slices, for 4 slices total.</li>
<li>~Making the round cut-out shape: Cut out large (8cm diameter) rounds from the cakes, and pack the cocoa into the white cake.</li>
<li>~Cut out another circle from the center of the cake: Cut out a small (φ4cm) circle, and place into the opposite cake.</li>
<li>Thinly coat the cake with frosting from Step 9, and stack up each slice so that the colors are alternating.</li>
<li>Attention: Actually all seven sections are coated with the Step 7 frosting.</li>
<li>Use the remaining amount of frosting to coat all around the cake and make a glacage♬.~Then just let it chill and solidify. ☝If you tilt the cake and spread it out while turning it, it will work out well.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Make the chocolate decorations, decorate the cake, ~and it is done!</li>
<li>This is the chocolate syrup I used. Use this in place of the plain cocoa and frosting, I recommend this for the glacage (icing). Heat this up in a hot water bath, and add in the gelatin that has been dissolved in water.</li>
