<ol>
<li>Melt the chocolate in a double broiler or by microwaving at 600 W for 1 minute.</li>
<li>Add 1 teaspoon of milk to the chocolate and mix together well. While keeping an eye on the appearance, add more milk little by little.</li>
<li>Use your hands to form into balls. Place the truffles and cocoa powder (etc.) into a plastic bag and shake.</li>
<li>Other than cocoa powder for the topping, you can also coat with granulated sugar etc., as well as other various arrangements. (I recommend pure cocoa powder)</li>
<li>How to Wrap 1-1: Cut a paper cup in half and insert the truffles.</li>
<li>1-2: Wrap with saran wrap from underneath the paper cut and gather together at the top.</li>
<li>1-3: Fasten it closed cutely with a ribbon or clasp, and it's finished.</li>
<li>Also, it would be cute if you drew a picture in the center of the wrap and then wrapped it up.</li>
<li>Since it's wrap, it's easy to draw on and you can fix the drawing as many times as necessary.</li>
<li>Of course, eating them as is is delicious.</li>
<li>How to Wrap 2-1: Prepare a dollar store napkin and paper cup, insert the truffles.</li>
<li>2-2: Turn the napkin inside out and cover the cup.</li>
<li>2-3: Tie with a ribbon, string, or rubber band as close to the top as possible.</li>
<li>2-4: Gather the napkin up at the top and twist. Tie a ribbon, string, rubber band, or piece of wire to keep it twisted. You're finished!</li>
<li>To make truffles with heavy cream and chocolate, see. I hope you take a look!</li>
<li>Wrapping Idea No. 3-1: Prepare coffee filters and wrap the truffles in wax paper.</li>
<li>3-2: Put in the truffles and open a hole with a hole puncher.</li>
<li>3-3: Use string from the dollar store to make a bow.</li>
<li>4: It's finished. Putting it into a baggie is also cute. If you're giving it to someone in just the coffee filter, I recommend punching the hole into the center. You can also stamp it.</li>
