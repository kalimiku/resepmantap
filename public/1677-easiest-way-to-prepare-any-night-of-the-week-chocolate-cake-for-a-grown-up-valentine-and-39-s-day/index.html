<li>Line a bowl with cling film and fill with a piece of sponge cake that's approximately the size of the mold. Brush the sponge with the syrup. Fill the cavity with plenty of chocolate cream and smooth out the surface.</li>
<li>Do the same process until all the bowls are done and cover with sponge lids and cling film. Chill in the fridge for 30 minutes to set.</li>
<li>Place a plate over the bowl and turn over to remove the cake from the bowl. Peel off the cling film. Spread the rest of the chocolate cream on the cake surface and stick the broken chocolate pieces onto the sides.</li>
<li>Sprinkle with cocoa powder through a tea strainer and you're done!!</li>
<li>It should look like this on the inside.</li>
</ol>
