<li>Add the stock to the pan, turn the heat up and when it starts bubbling, turn the heat off, add the cous cous</li>
<li>And cover the pan. Leave standing for 10 minutes and turn your attention to the turkey.</li>
<li>Turn the oven on - set at 250º. Line the baking tray with foil - leave enough either side to cover the turkey. Wash the turkey and pat dry with a clean cloth or kitchen paper. Wash you hands and cover them with oil, salt and pepper. Rub the turky all over  and wash your hands again</li>
<li>Take the lid off the pan. The cous cous should have asborbed all the liquid. If there is any remaining liquid at the bottom of the pan, just turn the heat on high and stir until it evaporates</li>
<li>Stuff the turkey. Don't pack it in too tightly . it needs some air pockets</li>
<li>Cover the turkey completely and put in the oven for 30 minutes at 250º. Then turn the heat down to 180º and leave for 90 minutes</li>
<li>When the 90 minutes are up, remove the foil. Get a family member to help you, then one of you can gently lift the head and then the rear of the turkey with a couple of large spoons or spatula, and the other can carefully remove the foil first from one end and then from the other. Put back in the oven for one more hour</li>
<li>During this last hour, baste the turkey every 15 minutes with the juices in the tray</li>
<li>Put the neck, giblets, garlic cloves, onion and bayleaf in a pan with a litre of water and start making the gravy. For full instructions on how to make turkey gravy see the link in the note next to this step.</li>
<li>When it looks ready, pierce the side of the turkey at the top of the thigh, and if the juices come out clean it is ready. If they are pink, it needs a little longer. Let the turkey stand for half an hour before carving. Pour yourself a glass of cava!!</li>
<li>Warm a large serving plate. Put the turkey stuffing in the middle and the meat around the edge. Drizzle a little gravy over turkey and stuffing and you're ready to go.</li>
<li>Serve with steamed brocoli and carrot or any vegetables of your choice (the water from the veg can go into the gravy) and homemade cranberry sauce (recipe in note. Enjoy!!</li>
</ol>
<p>The turkey is often the centrepiece of the Christmas table, so you want to do it justice. Too many times have I had dry, overcooked Christmas turkey with an average stuffing. This turkey and stuffing recipe was cooked and eaten by thousands of people last year who got the My Food Bag Christmas. Top tip for making Hairy Bikers' Christmas turkey with two stuffings. Wrapped in foil and covered with a towel, the turkey will keep warm.</p>
