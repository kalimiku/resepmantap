<p>This is a very versatile Indian curry sauce that can be served as a main course with meats and/or vegetables or as a sauce for dipping or to spice up veggie side dishes. It's great on a jacket potato. Curry, that intensely satisfying, warming dish, is primarily a sauce mixed into rice or used to coat tender meat. It is also what happened when the Brits invented the term and introduced it to the rest of the world.</p>
