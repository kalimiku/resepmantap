<p>Feijoada - Traditional Brazilian black bean and meat stew. FEIJOADA is a Brazilian black bean and pork stew served with white rice, farofa (toasted cassava flour), couve a mineira (pan-fried collard greens), and orange slices. It is the national dish of my home country, Brazil. Chorizo, pork ribs and pork shoulder make the base for this hearty Brazilian casserole with deeply savoury spiced pulses.</p>

Add one TBSP of butter then the manioc flour. It's important to keep mixing once you put the manioc flour in because it tends to brown quite quickly. Add the salt and mix more. Remove from the heat when it's brownish but not too much. Add the chopped parsley and it's ready!</li>
<li>Make the rice: In a medium pan, add the vegetable oil and fry the garlic until light brown. Add the rice and mix it with the garlic, add the salt and boiling water. Mix it well together and put the lid on. Lower the heat to number 2 and let it cook for around 20 minutes, do not remove the lid otherwise, the steam used to cook the rice will scape and it might burn before it's properly cooked.</li>
<li>To prepare the couve, in a medium pan at medium heat, add the oil and fry the garlic slightly, before it gets brown, add the finely chopped greens, add the salt and mix all well together. Let in sweat in low heat with the lid on for one minute. Remove from the heat, let it sweat a bit more with the lid on until serving. I like to do it at the last minute so it's still green and fresh.</li>
<li>When the beans are ready, add one TBSP on a large pan, fry ONE chopped onion, and THREE garlic cloves minced. When transparent, add the beans in and adjust the salt. Let it boil for 10 more minutes, and add water if it gets dry, feijoada has to have caldo (sauce).</li>
<li>To make the fried bananas, in a small bowl, mix the sugar and egg, beat till combined. Add the flour and the milk, mix till well incorporated. Dip the bananas in the batter. In a frying pan, add enough vegetable oil to cover half of the banana, and fry until golden brown then turn to brown the other side. Remove from the oil and let it drain in kitchen towel.</li>
<li>On a plate, add two generous spoons of rice, beans on top or on the side, like I do, and complete on the sides with some farofa to absorb the sauce of the beans, couve (greens), and bananas to finish. Enjoy!!</li>
