Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer for 25 min to allow the flavours to meld, partly covered.</li>
<li>Add a strainer to the top of a large pot on medium-high heat and drain the broth from step #2, straining out the onions, garlic, ginger and spices. To this broth, add the soy sauce and vegetables, partly cover, allowing to simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>
