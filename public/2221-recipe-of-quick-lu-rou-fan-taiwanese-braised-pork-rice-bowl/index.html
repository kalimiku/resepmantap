<li>Let the flavours infuse in the pot for a few minutes. Then add the carrots and shiitake mushrooms. Incorporate all of the ingredients well, for the aromas to be released. Add enough water to cover the pork, along with the dark soy, light soy, 1/4 cup shaoshing and a dash of sesame oil. Stir, add the rock sugar and mix well. Let the rock sugar dissolve, taste the sauce and adjust as needed (add more rock sugar or soy) and let it simmer for 15 minutes with a lid on.</li>
<li>Remove the lid, stir all of the ingredients together. Cover again with a lid and let it simmer for another 20 minutes. After second simmer add 1/3 cup shaoshing rice wine. Stir well to incorporate into mixture. Add the pre boiled eggs and reduce the heat to low. Now let it simmer for another 20 minutes to let the eggs marinade and for the meat to become soft and tender. Turn the eggs every so often to fully coat all over.</li>
<li>The sauce will slowly reduce and the meat will become soft and tender. Tip: If the sauce is loose, add a small amount of cornflour mixture to thicken it. Once the sauce has reduced and the meat is tender turn off heat and serve immediately while hot.</li>
<li>Place rice in a bowl and ladle over the meat and sauce. Remove an egg from the pot, carefully peel egg as it will be hot. Once the shell has been removed, cut egg in half. Garnish with spring onions on top (if adding to dish).</li>
