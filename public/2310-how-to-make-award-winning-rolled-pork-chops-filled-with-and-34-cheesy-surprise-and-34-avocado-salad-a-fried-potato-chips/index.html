<ol>
<li>I soaked my meat in milk over night (optional), dry before removing bone and fat from the pork chops and tenderize with a tenderizer hammer, make sure they are nice and thin. Season with salt and pepper. Prepare 3 dishes 1 for flour and paprika mix, 1 for beaten egg and one for breadcrumbs.</li>
<li>Prepare stuffing: mash boiled egg with a fork, add grated cheese, finely chopped onion, salt, pepper, basil and chopped parsley mix well. With a spoon add generous amount of stuffing to each chops and roll them up like a sausage. Secure it with tooth-picks so they won't open up during cooking. Roll each of them in flour, then egg and last into breadcrumbs and fry on medium heat in generous amount of hot oil (for about 10 minutes), turning them over to get cooked evenly.Dry them on kitchen paper.</li>
<li>Wash and cut potatoes into 8 wedges boil for 3 minutes, drain then fry them in hot oil. Prepare the salad, cut lettuce, avocado, tomato into small pieces, slice red onion. Mix salad dressing ingredients and pour over salad. Sprinkle potatoes with left over stuffing. ENJOY.</li>
</ol>
<p>Combine the flour and some cayenne, salt and black pepper. Dredge each side of the pork chops in the flour mixture, and then set aside on a plate. Really very tasty and simpke to make. I adjusted things by using pork fillet and added sun-dried tomatoes rather than spinach keaves. They turn out so juicy and tender and, so far, my husband has had me make these chops for tailgating parties, house parties, supper with the kids, dinner for us two.he can't get enough!</p>
