<p>Hello everybody, hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, I&rsquo;m gonna show you how to make a distinctive dish, vegan sourdough challah. It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I&rsquo;m gonna make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>
<p>A Vegan Eggless Sourdough Challah with the perfect crust and crumb. Aquafaba stands in for the eggs. Eat it by itself, or use for French toast or pudding.</p>
<p>Vegan Sourdough Challah is one of the most favored of recent trending meals on earth. It&rsquo;s enjoyed by millions every day. It&rsquo;s easy, it&rsquo;s fast, it tastes yummy. Vegan Sourdough Challah is something that I&rsquo;ve loved my entire life. They&rsquo;re nice and they look fantastic.</p>
<p>To get started with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few components. You can cook vegan sourdough challah using 7 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-vegan-sourdough-challah">The ingredients needed to make Vegan Sourdough Challah:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Prepare 500 g flour</li>
<li>Get 250 ml water</li>
<li>Prepare 25 g sourdough starter</li>
<li>Take 5 g salt (roughly 1tsp)</li>
<li>Get 50 g sunflower/coconut/canola oil</li>
<li>Prepare 50 g agave syrup (or honey)</li>
<li>Take 80 g aquafaba/chickpea water</li>
</ol>
<p>My vegan Challah recipe uses aquafaba and sugar to recreate the texture and sweetness of challah bread. Most water challahs are vegan but I've noticed some challah use honey, instead of sugar! I baked my first challah last Thursday and wanted to share. I was unsure what to expect but it was so much fun.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="steps-to-make-vegan-sourdough-challah">Steps to make Vegan Sourdough Challah:</h5>
<ol>
<li>The night before, start the dough. Dissolve starter in water then add flour. Knead a bit. Add salt. The dough will be quite dry. (It's going to get wetter tomorrow when you add the other ingredients). Rub dough with oil, wrap in clingfilm and leave overnight at room temperature.</li>
<li>In the morning, add the chickpea juice, the honey and the oil. If this makes the dough too wet, add a bit more flour. You are aiming for the dough to be <em>slightly</em> wet/sticky. Cover with the clingfilm and leave to prove for 4 hours (but do a round of folds every hour)</li>
<li>Cut the dough into 6 equal portions (or 5, 4, 3 etc). You'll probably want to use scales to weigh make sure the portions are the same weight. Form each portion into a ball, cover and leave to rest for 20mins.</li>
<li>Roll each of the balls into a sausage shape. Braid the sausages together. Me describing the process here will not help you - search for challah braiding videos on YouTube. Put the braided loaf on a baking tray and cover with clingfilm. Prove for 3 hours at room temperature or until it has doubled in size.</li>
<li>Heat oven to 180C with a tray of water in the bottom. Brush outside of challah with chickpea water. Sprinkle with seeds if desired. Bake for 45 mins (my dough weighed 1030g).</li>
</ol>
<p>I'd been meaning for some time to bake a recipe. This vegan challah has never been better. This rich and eggy pastry has never been better. Made with chickpea flour eggs for a light and airy enriched dough that is baked to. Finding a solid sourdough challah recipe has been on my bread baking list for awhile.</p>
<p>So that is going to wrap this up for this special food vegan sourdough challah recipe. Thanks so much for reading. I&rsquo;m confident that you will make this at home. There is gonna be more interesting food at home recipes coming up. Don&rsquo;t forget to save this page on your browser, and share it to your loved ones, friends and colleague. Thanks again for reading. Go on get cooking!</p>
